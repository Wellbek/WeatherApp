## Description

### Purpose 

I've hoped to aquire knowledge in front end developement since I tended more towards back end developement unitl this day. 

This project allowed me to aquire experience in front end client developement, introduced me to a new programming language [Dart](https://dart.dev/), and further practiced my ability to work with APIs.

### Flutter

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is an open-source UI SDK created by Google, which allows for multiplatform developement for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and the web from a single codebase.

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) was only released in 2017 and is competing with other multiplatform frameworks and SDKs like [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/). [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) are currently the most employed SDKs for cross-platform software developement.
